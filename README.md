This is a project I undertook in 2022, while I relearned Python at an introductory level. It used Turtle Graphics to draw select self-similar fractals to an input number of iterations. I was not able to write elegant code at the time, and didn't know much about conventions and best practices, but I understood the concept of recursion well and wanted practice.
